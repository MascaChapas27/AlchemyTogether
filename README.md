Thank you for visiting the GitHub repository! Here you can find the full code for the game (some parts are ugly as hell because this game was made for a Game Jam and I wanted to make sure I made it on time).

Please, feel free to visit the "Issues" tab at the top part of the webpage if you have any problem that needs to be solved. If you want to download the latest version, go to the [itch.io page](https://mascachapas27.itch.io/alchemy-together), or click on "Releases" at the right side.
